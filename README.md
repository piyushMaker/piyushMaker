- 👋 Hi, I’m @piyushMaker, I am stuck in a loop of "TO design, to develop, to test, to update and to iterate over again"
- 👀 I’m interested NLP, Computer Vision, DL, IoT and Robotics, actually in all sort of technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI Product Management and some Chapter in Statistics or Calculus.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI Startups, Lectures for Students/Enthusiast, and Career Guidance.
